**AI Application Functioning**

This AI application, adigon, is developed using TypeScript and is designed for scalable, intelligent automation. The core functionalities include:
Data Processing: Efficiently handles input data and processes it through AI-driven algorithms to generate actionable insights.
User Interaction: Provides a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
Automation: Automates key tasks to save time and minimize errors, adapting to user needs.
Integration: Easily integrates with other platforms and services for extended functionality.
The working diagram above (diagram 3) visually represents the flow of data and processes within the application, illustrating how information moves from input, through AI processing, and out to the user or other systems.
